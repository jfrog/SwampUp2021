### In this training session, youâ€™ll learn about the levels of security built into Artifactory and how to leverage them for your setup, as well as extend them with user plugins to provide a custom ACL and permission model. We will get hands-on experience with access tokens, establishing the circle of trust on federated instances and clusters, etc.


#### <ins>Who should attend:</ins> Developers, DevOps Engineers and Development Managers who are looking to get hands-on experience with securing Artifactory and securely integrating JFrog Artifactory into their pipeline.

#### <ins>Prerequisites</ins>: Knowledgeable with Git and Docker (git and docker clients installed including having a GitHub account). Basic understanding of DevOps concepts (familiarity with JFrog Artifactory).

#### <ins>Lab #1 - Onboarding to Labs Environment</ins>

- Run ```git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/SwampUp2021.git``` against your forked repository.
- Run ```cd SwampUp2021/SU-302-Advanced-Artifactory-Security``` which is our class's folder with all the relevant code.
- Open the file "back/src/pipelines.resources" and change the configuration.path in the following snippet based on your github username:</br>

- Commit the changes to your forked repository:
 ```
git add .
git commit -m "updated my repo path in the source code resource"
git push
```
- Create the following Integrations (Administration Panel -> Pipelines -> Integrations -> Add an Integration):
    - "github" integration (type: "GitHub") with [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) from your github account:</br>

Complete/answer the following tasks/questions:
- Run all pipelines until your environment is GREEN:
![alt text](http://g.recordit.co/xaZV0g6i21.gif)

- Understand the relationship between the different pipelines - in what ways a pipeline can be triggered?
- How many repositories were created for the backend application?
- How many repositories were created for the frontend application?

#### <ins>Lab #3 - Adding Security</ins>

- Index all builds from Xray's Administration Panel (Xray -> Settings -> Builds):
![alt text](http://g.recordit.co/6V3mjmz2bz.gif)
- View the security issues and license discovered by Xray for every individual build.
- Add one Security and one License Policies: [Creating a Policy](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Creating+Xray+Policies+and+Rules#CreatingXrayPoliciesandRules-CreatingaPolicy).
- Add a watch per application (one watch for the backend; one watch for the frontend) and assign the policies you have created to these watches: [Configure Xray Watches](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray+Watches).
- Explore the violations that were NOW created.
