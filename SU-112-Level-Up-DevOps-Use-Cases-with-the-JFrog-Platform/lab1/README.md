#### Lab goals:

Hands-on experience with the available JFrog automation tools.

#### Step4: Populate some content on your new repositories using the JFrog CLI

For simplicity weâ€™ll copy a docker image and a helm chart that are already available in our environment.


```
$ jfrog rt cp su112-docker-dev-local/nginx/ acme-docker-dev-local/nginx/
$ jfrog rt cp su112-helm-local/nginx/ acme-helm-dev-local/nginx/
