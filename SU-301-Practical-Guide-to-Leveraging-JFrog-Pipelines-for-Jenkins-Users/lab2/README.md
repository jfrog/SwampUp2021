# Lab 2

1. In `lab2/{java,python}/pipelines.resources.yml`, Update the git resource by using your own git repo :
```
      path: cyan21/SwampUp2021
```

2. In `lab2/{java,python}/pipelines.steps.yml` and `lab2/{java,python}/Dockerfile`, replace all the occurences of **swampup301.jfrog.io** with your own JFrog Platform URL 

3. Modify your pipeline source by editing the  **Pipeline Config File Filter** :
* java : `SU-301-Practical-Guide-to-Leveraging-JFrog-Pipelines-for-Jenkins-Users\/lab2\/java\/pipelines.*\.yml`
* python : `SU-301-Practical-Guide-to-Leveraging-JFrog-Pipelines-for-Jenkins-Users\/lab2\/python\/pipelines.*\.yml`

4. Run the pipeline and fix it :P

> Hint for troubleshooting : you may need another integration ...

> Note : We could have merged the 2 pipelines by using a Multi stage docker file. However you would have missed the basics of JFrog pipelines :)

Extra : 
* Have a look to the pipeline you didn't choose
