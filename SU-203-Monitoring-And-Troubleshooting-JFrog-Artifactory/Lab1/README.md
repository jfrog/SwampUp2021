* **Q**: What is the general default log level?

<details>
    <summary>Expand for step-by-step answer</summary>

* **A**: Check `system.yaml` for logging level and `logback.xml`
    * Connect to JFrog Artifactory instance using SSH
    * Navigate to: `$JFROG_HOME/<product>/var/etc/`
    * Print\View `system.yaml`
    * Look for this section:
    ```
  frontend:
      logging:
        application:
            level: debug
  ```
    * If you didn't find the section above, let's check the `logback.xml` file:
        * Navigate to: `$JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/logback.xml`
        * Print\View `logback.xml`
        * Look for this section:
    ```
  <!-- JFrog loggers -->
        <logger name="org.artifactory" level="info" />
        <logger name="org.jfrog" level="info" />
        ...
  ```
</details>

* **Q**: How much free space left on your JFrog Artifactory instance? (please use both of the UI option, and the REST API option)

<details>
    <summary>Expand for step-by-step answer</summary>

* **A1**: Navigate through the Monitoring section at the Admin view on the UI
    * Login to your JFrog Artifactory instance with an admin user
    * Switch to the `Administration` tab
    * Navigate to the `Monitoring`-->`Storage` section

![Storage](images/q3.png?raw=true "Storage")
    
* **A2**: Use of `Storage Info` REST API
    * Invoke (with an admin user): `https://your_jfrog_artifactory_host:your_jfrog_artifactory_port/artifactory/api/storageinfo`
        * You can use your favorite REST Client or this `curl` command:
        `curl -uADMIN_USERNAME https://your_jfrog_artifactory_host:your_jfrog_artifactory_port/artifactory/api/storageinfo | json_pp`

* **Q**: Add a custom property to an artifact (through the UI) and find its request and trace ID, then mention which Microservices were part of this request
    * **Hint**: Please use this artifact: (already populated to your Artifactory instance)

* **A**:
    * Go over [Artifactory architecture diagram](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/System+Architecture) for reference
    * Browse to the pre-populated artifact using your default browser
        * Navigate to `Artifacts` section
        * Navigate to repository: ``
        * Expand and navigate to artifact: ``
        * Switch to Properties tab
        * Add custom property: key=swampUp, value=2021
    * Connect to your JFrog Artifactory instance using SSH
    * Navigate to: `$JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/log/`
    * Start with finding the first log line represents the request for that artifact in: `router-request.log`
      ```

    * Copy the TraceId (`request_Uber-Trace-Id` - from start to first semicolon)
        * TraceId from the log snippet above will be: "request_Uber-Trace-Id":"**_27d6c2004320ef8a_**:144b74101317f73d:27d6c2004320ef8a:0"
    * Search for the whole logs with that TraceId (you can use this grep command: `grep *.* -e TRACE_ID`)
